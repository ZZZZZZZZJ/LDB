# LDB
The official codes for learning dynamic background for weakly supervised moving object detection

LDB -- Version released on Sep.12 2021.

1. This package of codes has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LT, with Matlab version R2017a
2. gco-v3.0 is needed and has been included in the package.
3. LDB detects moving objects, typically in dynamic scenes.
   RPCA, LSD, DECOLOR, TVRPCA, GOSUS, OMoGMF is for comparison
   test_videos uses various algorithms and dataset to detect moving objects.
   config_by_dataname demonstrates the directory of sequence, and testing frame regions.
   obtain_algorithm_function indicates the function of different algorithms.

Thanks.
